# A_Tkinter_GUI_Desktop_Application
A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed.
In this program, we use the tkinter module to create a GUI window with three elements: a label with the test text, an entry field for the user's input, and a button to start the test. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the program initializes some variables, deletes the contents of the input field, and binds the check_input method to the Return key and the cancel_test method to the Escape key. The check_input method compares the user's input against the test text and updates the label and input field accordingly. If the user types the entire test text correctly, the end_test method calculates the typing speed and displays the results in a message box. The cancel_test method unbinds the key bindings and disables the input field.
